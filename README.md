# Coursera---JHU-Data-Science
My completed assignments from Johns Hopkins' Data Science Coursera course

Here's the thing. I'm a bit of a cheapskate, and while I wanted to do the JHU Data Science course on Coursera, I didn't want to pay for it.
Instead I'm putting the completed assignment's here as my proof of completion.
I'm happy to take suggestions on how I should structure the folders and present the assignments - so please fork away.

Thanks.
