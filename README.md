# Coursera---JHU-Data-Science
My completed assignments from Johns Hopkins' Data Science Coursera course

Here's the thing. I'm a bit of a cheapskate, and while I wanted to do the JHU Data Science course on Coursera, I didn't want to pay for it.
Instead I'm putting the completed assignment's here as my proof of completion.
I'm happy to take suggestions on how I should structure the folders and present the assignments - so please fork away.

###Here are the courses that are involved in the specializtion:

*The Data Scientist’s Toolbox
*R Programming
*Getting and Cleaning Data
*Exploratory Data Analysis
*Reproducible Research
*Statistical Inference
*Regression Models
*Practical Machine Learning
*Developing Data Products
*Data Science Capstone
